**Our hero has been bludgeoned by reality** *(study or perish)*

## Notes

* This semester I have been assigned to [Dr. Tannenbaum](https://cba.unl.edu/people/dtannenbaum/) as a T.A. for [ECON 417](https://bulletin.unl.edu/undergraduate/courses/ECON/417). In addition to attending his class and keeping office hours, I will also be holding [recitation](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=recitation).

* According to the cohort ahead of me, STAT 883 & ACTS 870 will be two of the hardest courses you take throughout the program.
